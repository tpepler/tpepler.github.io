<h1>Sourdough bread</h1>
Makes one medium sized loaf<br>
<br>
This recipe is more or less poached from the one given <a href="http://www.sourdough.co.uk/a-basic-sourdough-recipe/">here</a>.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<li>300g water</li>
<li>100g sourdough leaven ('starter')</li>
<li>150g organic wholemeal flour</li>
<li>350g organic strong white flour</li>
<li>10g fine sea salt mixed with 15g of cold water</li>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the afternoon of the day before you want to bake the bread, in a large bowl whisk your water and starter and mix well. Add the flour and mix until all the ingredients come together into a large ball.</li><br>
<li>Cover with a clean damp cloth and let the dough rest on the side in the kitchen for between 30 minutes and 2 hours - this what bakers call <i>autolyse</i>.</li><br>
<li>Add the salt mixed with the water and dimple your fingers into the dough to allow the salty water and salt to distribute evenly throughout the dough. Leave for 10 minutes.</li><br>
<li>Next lift and fold your dough over, do a quarter turn of your bowl and repeat three more times. Repeat 3 times at 30 minute intervals with a final 15 minute rest at the end.</li><br>
<li>Shape the dough lightly into a ball and then place into a round bowl. If the surface of the bowl isn't non-stick, smear a thin layer of olive oil inside to prevent the dough from sticking too much. Cover the bowl with a damp tea-towel.</li><br>
<li>Leave your dough to one side until it is 50% bigger. Then transfer to the fridge and leave to prove there for 8 - 12 hours overnight.</li><br>
<li>The next morning, preheat your oven to 220&deg;C (or 190&deg;C, if using a fan oven). Place a baking tray in the oven and a large pan of boiling water underneath (or use a Dutch oven). The hydration helps to form a beautiful crust.</li><br>
<li>Once the oven is up to full heat, put your dough onto the baking tray and slash the top with a knife. This decides where the bread will tear as it rises. Bake for 35 minutes.</li><br>
<li>Turn the heat down to 180&deg;C (fan oven: 170&deg;C), remove the water tray and bake for another 10 - 15  minutes.</li>
</ol>
