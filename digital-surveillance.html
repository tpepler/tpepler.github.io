<h1>Why I resist using closed-source/proprietary software tools</h1>
<i>Theo Pepler</i>

<p>
We live in an age of massive electronic surveillance. Digital tools developed in the past few decades, including the internet, are unsurpassed in their ability to reach into the very private corners of our lives. Many of these tools are closed-source (proprietary), essentially black boxes collecting data about us in a very opaque way, and often using this data in ways we would object to. Aggregation in big data sources allow the owners of such tools to develop detailed profiles of us.
</p>

<p>
If selling my personal data to marketers to enable personalised marketing, discriminatory pricing, and information filtering were the worst consequences, I would still be annoyed. But using these tools and allowing them to gather data about you---both overtly and covertly---exposes you to the risk that some of your data may end up in the wrong hands or even in the public domain. Data which may include very private conversations and photos---of you, your family, and your friends. Even if the terms of service of the custodians do not allow them to share your data with third parties, malicious crackers can steal and pass it on.
</p>

<p>
Privacy is not about having something to hide. There is a difference between <i>secret</i> things and <i>private</i> things. When I go to a public toilet, I close the cubicle door behind me. Not because what I do there is a secret, but because some things in life are private. Even if I have nothing to hide, I value my privacy.
</p>

<p>
I also value my personal freedom, freedom of speech and ideas, and living in a global society where you are not discriminated against based on your nationality, faith, gender, age, ethnic origin, income, employment status or anything else. That is why I resist using closed-source proprietary tools and services which may end up spying on me and those I care about. These include the following:
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>WhatsApp</li>
<li>All Google products (incl. Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and Hangouts/Meet)</li>
<li>All Microsoft products (incl. Windows, Office, and Skype)</li>
<li>All Apple products</li>
</p>
