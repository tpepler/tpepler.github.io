<h3>HOWTO: CALCULATE TYPE I, II AND III SUMS OF SQUARES FOR ANOVA IN R</h3>

<p>When performing an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for a fitted model, there are different ways to calculate the sums of squares (SS) for the model effects. A good readable explanation of the different types of SS, generally called I, II and III, can be found <a href="https://mcfromnz.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/anova-type-iiiiii-ss-explained/">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>I would argue to <i>always</i> use type II SS when doing an ANOVA</b>. If you have a model with no interactions, fitted on data from a balanced design, the different types of SS will all lead to the same result. However, if there are interactions fitted in your model, and/or you have an unbalanced design, the SS (and resulting ANOVA tables) will differ. One should start by interpreting any interactions in the model, and <i>only interpret the main effects if there are no significant interactions</i> (between the main effects being interpreted). If the interaction(s) are not significant, type II SS give more powerful tests of the main effects.</p>

<p>To perform ANOVA with type II SS in R:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load the <tt>car</tt> library<br>
<br>
<tt>require(car)</tt><br>
<br></li>

<li>To perform ANOVA for a fitted model (called <i>myModel</i>, for example)<br>
<br>
<tt>Anova(myModel, type = 'II')</tt>
</li>
</ol>
